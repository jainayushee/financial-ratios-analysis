    "1. Select a company and extract the following data from Yahoo Finance:\n",
    "    - Balance sheet\n",
    "    - Income statement\n",
    "    - Cash flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the following ratios for the last four business years:\n",

    "2. Profitability Ratios:\n",
    "    - Gross Profit Margin\n",
    "    - Net Profit Margin\n",
    "    - Return on Equity\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Efficiency Ratios:\n",
    "    - Inventory Turnover\n",
    "    - Receivables Turnover\n",
    "    - Asset Turnover\n",
    "    - Payables Turnover\n",

    "    - Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the calculated ratios, write a short analysis of the companies performance. Support your analysis using at least 2 but not more than 4 plots. Your analysis should highlight one potential area of improvement in the balance sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:\n",
    "- The readability and structure of your code.\n",
    "- Your code could be easily run for a different company or different financial year.\n",
    "- The quality of your plots and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use **only** Python for this exercise and do not download the data manually (download it in your code). \n",
    "For each metric calculated, please write the formula used as an inline comment or in markdown. If you are not sure how a certain ratio is defined, please write a comment with your train of thought.\n",
    "There is no need to write comments for simple code operations. However, if you use any \"tricks\" or unusual features in your code, please use an inline comment. "
